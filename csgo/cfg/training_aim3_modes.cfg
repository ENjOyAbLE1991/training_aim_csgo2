echo "You can choose between 5 different training modes."
echo " "
echo "_____Classic (Fast Aiming): the classic training_aim mode with static, linear and rotating targets. There is a little bug with this mode that I have not been able to fix: sometimes it stops spawning targets without stopping the training. Don't care too much since this only happened to me few times, just restart the training :)"
echo " "
echo "_____Angles and sliding: here you have two integrated modes (Angles and sliding) that will help you to improve your muscle memory for certain important angles."
echo " "
echo "_____Reflex training: here you will train your response time for improving how fast you shoot at enemies once you see them. A big target will spawn in the center in red (classic) color. You have to wait a random time between 2 and 6 seconds for the target to get blue, once that happens you need to shoot at it quickly before it becomes red again. Some players can reach a response time of 0.19 or less (I recommend to start with 0.29 or 0.3)."
echo " "
echo "_____Burst training: Here you can spawn a target in the center with your choosed size (or head shape) and shoot at it continiously trying to keep the bullets going on the target and not around it. Counters will count how many shots you fail and how many you hit. Practise with head shapes, it's difficult but you will be able to burst at heads easily ingame."
echo " "
echo "_____Intensive Fast Aiming: this is similar to classic but only with static targets. It will spawn targets throw the wall continiously until you reach the targets limit (configurable). I really love this mode for training deagle aim :P."

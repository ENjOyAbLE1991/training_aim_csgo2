echo "_____Mode: choose between two different modes: angles and sliding."
echo " "
echo "__________Angles mode: it will spawn a center target. The test timer will start counting down once you hit the center target (yellow). Then it starts spawning random targets (According to the angles and distances selected). You have to hit the center target every time for spawning the next target. This way you have to return to the center everytime."
echo " "
echo "__________Sliding mode: it will spawn two symmetric targets (According to the angle and distance selected). The timer will start counting down once you hit the first target. Try to hit as many times as you can during the test time sliding from target to target. IMPORTANT: please note that distances 3 and 4 doesn't have Y and 45 degrees axes. If you select any of these combinations the test will not start."

echo "_____Axis traces: choose what axes to draw in the wall."

echo "In the angles mode we have these options:"
echo " "
echo "_____Tar. types: choose what kind of targets (angles) do you want to spawn randomly. Targets in the X axis, Y axis, 45 degrees axis or the rest (divide 45 degrees by 3)."
echo " "
echo "_____Distances: choose what distances do you want to spawn the targets. The first distance is the smallest circle drawed in the wall and the fourth one is the biggest. IMPORTANT: please note that distances 3 and 4 doesn't have Y and 45 degrees axes. If you select any of these combinations the test will not start."
echo " "
echo "In the slide mode you just choose what distance and what axis do you want to spawn two symmetric targets for training the sliding."

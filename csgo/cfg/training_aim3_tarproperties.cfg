echo "Here you can configure the main properties of the targets being spawned."
echo " "
echo "_____Size: choose the size of the target. For example: 24R means a 24 inch. radius. You can choose head shaped targets instead of circular ones. In this case it will spawn head targets picking randomly between the 8 different skins of heads of CS:S."
echo "_____Random size: If choosed it will spawn random sizes (not including 5R, 3R and 2R)."
echo " "
echo "_____Heads too: if random size enabled, you can choose between including heads or not."
echo " "
echo "_____Color: choose the color. Classic red and blue (from training_aim and training_aim2) are included in addition to the pure red and blue"
echo " "
echo "_____Random color: it picks a random color in every spawn"
echo " "
echo "_____Shots to kill: choose the number of shots you will have to do for killing the target. This is really useful for training bursts of 2 or 3 with ak47 or other weapons."
echo " "
echo "This option has two little bugs that I couldn't fix but they doesn't affect too much at the training: when using some fast weapons (TMP, GLOCK with burst mode, M249, UCI, MP5, P90 and FAMAS with burst mode) you will need to hit one more time for killing the target. For example, if this options is set to 3, and you get a glock in burst mode, it won't break with one burst, you will need at least 4 shots (so set this setting to 2)."
echo " "
echo "The other bug is just that the first spawned target will need one hit less for breaking. For example with this setting set to 3, the fist target will need 2 hits for breaking. I really don't know why this happens but I don't care too much since it's only the first target."

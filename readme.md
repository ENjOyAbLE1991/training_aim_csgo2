#training_aim_csgo2
##Alpha 1

For the past few months I've been training on kataS' famous training_aim_csgo map. I've been making some changes thanks to the fact that he released the original VMF and materials. This is the first public release.

###Changelog from Concept map:
-Shooting wall texture is now orange dev grid

-Bloom and HDR is disabled

-Start/stop buttons are embedded in to each wall, as to not accidentally be triggered by stray bullets

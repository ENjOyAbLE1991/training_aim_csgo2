#training_aim_csgo2
##Current release: 0.2.0

For the past few months I've been training on kataS' famous training_aim_csgo map.
There were a lot of gameplay and graphical bugs that I wanted to address. 
I also ended up adding and improving a lot of features as well. 
This is a work in progress, so subscribe and please leave feedback.
